# 🧠 Interview Trainer Agent – AICTE Edunet IBM SkillBuild Internship

Welcome to my project repository for the **Interview Trainer Agent**, developed as part of the **AICTE Edunet - IBM SkillBuild Internship**. This AI-powered agent is designed to simulate real job interviews using advanced language models and IBM Cloud technologies.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The Interview Trainer Agent uses **Agentic AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to simulate a realistic 5-question mock interview tailored to a user’s job role or resume. After the mock interview, the agent provides a **holistic feedback report** including:

- Final performance score (out of 10)
- Communication style analysis
- Technical depth evaluation
- Key strengths & areas of improvement
- 3–5 personalized improvement tips

## 💻 Technologies Used

- IBM Watsonx & Granite LLM
- IBM Cloud (Lite services)
- Agentic AI Concepts
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt Engineering
- Python & JSON-based agent instructions

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

1. **User Input**: Upload a resume or enter a job title (e.g., “Python Developer”).
2. **Questioning Phase**: Agent asks 5 role-specific interview questions.
3. **User Response**: User answers each question interactively.
4. **Analysis Phase**: After 5 questions, the agent analyzes all responses.
5. **Final Report**: Agent shares detailed feedback and improvement tips.
